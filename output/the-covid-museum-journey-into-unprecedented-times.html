	<span class="post-date">Wed 20 November 2024</span>
	<h2>Data Schema</h2>
<p>Museum Exhibit Summary</p>
<p>The COVID Museum will display a variety of artifacts from the 2019-2021 era of the COVID-19 pandemic at the local Guelph gallery from January until early February. This exhibit will take visitors on a journey through the early stages of the pandemic and highlight its cultural impact on society.</p>
<p>The star artifact of the health exhibit is the COVID-19 Rapid Response Antigen tests. Rapid Antigen self-testing kits were an important tool in the pandemic designed to detect the presence of virus proteins. These tests were often given out for free in pharmacies, test centres, and grocery stores and were useful for mass testing in schools, workplaces, large events, and travel. These tests are important to help control outbreaks and limit transmission of the virus.</p>

<p>Contextual and Ethical Considerations</p>
<p>When expanding the COVID-19 exhibit into a larger collection, we would focus on educating the younger generation born during the pandemic or in early education. The key highlights and exhibits of the museum could include: (1) A look into health care and warding against catching the virus. (2) The social impact and how we interact with the public and online spaces. (3) Environmental change and how COVID reversed significant environmental issues. When curating a more extensive collection, we hope the government, frontline, healthcare workers, and older generations contribute to the database and exhibit.</p>
<p>Throughout history, the pattern of pandemics has helped us respond to new breakouts in public health and tests the civil liberties given to us by the government. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our civil liberties were limited, including the mandate to self-test for COVID-19. Self-testing before going out in public was mandatory if you had cold and flu symptoms. Covid-19 also acted as a stress test on society and shaped a new culture of life 6 feet apart with limited in-person social interaction.</p>
<p>We have curated the exhibit based on a timeline of events starting in late 2019 to late 2022. Using “Date of release” metadata, we can provide insight into how each stage of the pandemic progressed and the new science and technologies released to combat COVID-19. In 10 years, data collected from COVID-19 will still be used to influence research, medical insights, and societal efforts. In 20 years, the data may be interpreted as a historical case study, mainly used as an educational tool and a comparative framework to highlight what did and did not work in case of future pandemics. In 100 years, the data may be interpreted and focus more on its role in shaping the generations in the 21st century and the social justice and equity issues of the time. Some data collected may fade into myth or simplification, only focusing on the key events.</p>
<p>Reflection</p>
<p>The way objects are encoded shapes how they are interpreted because encoding determines how information is processed, understood, and remembered. A detailed database of information about an object can keep the information accurate in its value and source. The more consciously an object is encoded, the more transparent and effective communication becomes, leaving little room for misinterpretation. The control of data curation processes reflects an object's underlying values, biases, and power. For example, there is a selection bias when curating the COVID museum by deciding which artifacts to digitize and prioritize. Selection bias reflects not only the museum and intuitional priorities but also cultural values. The way the story is told is up to the power of the curators and archivists of the exhibit and less on the people the exhibit topic impacted.</p>
