	<h2>Three sources for Community in the OED</h2>
<p>Three sources for Community in the OED</p>
<p>Student name: Emily Scott</p>
<p>Student Number: 1233757</p>
<p>Style of citation used: MLA (8th edition)</p>
<p>“Were they all naked, and banished from the Heralds books, they are without any euidence of preheminence, and their soules cannot defend them from Community”Cornwallis, William. Essayes ; Discourses upon Seneca the Tragedian / by Sir William</p>
<p>Cornwallyes, the Younger, Knight. Printed by T. Harper for I. M[arriott], and are to be sold by A. Ritherdon, 1631-1632, 1632.</p>
<p>I found this book by researching through the OED, going to the McLaughlin Library omni archive, and finding an open-access edition in the Hathi Trust catalogue online. This edition is older, from 1631 instead of 1600, and the punctuation is slightly different due to it being old English and the modern-day keyboard cannot punctuate the differences in the OED. This very early quotation of community is significant because it displays how an armature essayist views community drawn from his own experience, thus; showing a glimpse of how the word was used nearly 400 years ago. The quote articulates the idea that without external markers of status, people are fundamentally equal and that all individuals share common humanity and vulnerability to the same realities of life.</p>
<p>“Europe was broken into many separate communities”</p>
<p>Robertson, William. The History of the Reign of the Emperor Charles V. : With a View of the Progress of Society in Europe, from the Subversion of the Roman Empire, to the Beginning of the Sixteenth Century. Printed by J. J. Harper, 1829, 1829.</p>
<p>I found this book by researching through the OED, going to the McLaughlin Library omni archive, and finding an open-access edition in the Hathi Trust catalogue online. This edition is later than the one cited in the OED, but the quotation remained consistent. This quotation is significant because Robertson was a Historian, having written 5 historical publications from 1755-1796 and was the principal of the University of Edinburgh where there is an endowed chair in his name. The quote is interesting because it highlights the fragmentation of Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire, leading to isolated regions with limited communication and cooperation. The use of the word communities for segregation shows how the word grew over time to symbolize a sense of togetherness as we know it today.</p>
<p>“The Community had come back in a body from country and seaside, in time for the impending religious festivals.”</p>
<p>Levy, Amy. Reuben Sachs : A Sketch / by Amy Levy. Macmillan and Co., 1888, 1888.</p>
<p>I found this book by researching through the OED, going to the McLaughlin Library omni archive, and finding an open-access edition in the Hathi Trust catalogue online. This source is significant because it was commented on by famous author, Oscar Wilde, about its uncompromising truths and depth of feeling. This quote emphasizes the idea of community as a group by sharing traditions with people from all walks of life. It</p>
<p>highlights the strength of a community and its sense of belonging centred around common cultural activities.</p>
